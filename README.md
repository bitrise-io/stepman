# stepman

You can manage decentralized StepLib Step (script) Collections with `stepman`.

You can register multiple collections, audit them, manage the caching of individual Steps locally,
define and handle fallback URLs for downloading the Step codes (archives),
and share new Steps into public StepLib collections with `stepman`.

**Public Beta:** this repository is still under active development,
frequent changes are expected, but we we don't plan to introduce breaking changes,
unless really necessary. **Feedback is greatly appreciated!**

*Part of the Bitrise Continuous Integration, Delivery and Automations Stack,
