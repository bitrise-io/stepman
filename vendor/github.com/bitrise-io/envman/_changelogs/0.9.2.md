## Changes

* __BREAKING__ : New environment model structure. Environment model became a new field, `opts`, which contains the environment variable options. Current environment options:
    * Title (string)
    * Description (string)
    * ValueOptions (array of strings/booleans)
    * IsRequired (boolean)
    * IsExpand (boolean)
    * IsDontChangeValue (boolean).
* `envman run cmd` returns the command's exit code
