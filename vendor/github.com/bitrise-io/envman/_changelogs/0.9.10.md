## Changes

* Environments got a new field: `IsTemplate` / `is_template`. This field indicates whether the value contains template expressions which should be evaluated before using the value, just like in case of `is_expand`. *This property is not used directly in `envman`, although this might change in the future.*
* Improved environment value and options cast:
    * Now you can use `"NO"`, `"No"`, `"YES"`, `"Yes"`, `true`, `false`, `"true"`, `"false"` in every place `envman` expects a bool value (ex: `is_expand`).
    * Every field where `envman` expects a string in now casted into a string. This means that you can now use `true` and `false` instead of `"true"` and `"false"` in `value_options`. Same is true for the value itself, so you can now write `true` instead of `"true"` and it'll still be casted to string.
