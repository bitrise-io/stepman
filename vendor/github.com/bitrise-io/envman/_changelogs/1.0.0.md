## Changes

* Removed unnecessary log : `[ENVMAN] - Failed to execute command: XYZ`
* Run command exist code fix: if executing the command failed, but command exit code was 0, `envman run` exit code was 0, instead of valid exit code. It'll now return `1` as the exit code in this case.
* `envman` configs file handling. Path it: `$HOME/.envman/configs.json`. Configs contains the maximum allowed environment value size in KB (20 KB default) and the maximum allowed environment list size in KB (100 KB default).
